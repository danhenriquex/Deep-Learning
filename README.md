Applications of Deep Learning

1. The first project consisted in a convolutional implementation where we learned how to work with padding and no-padding and how to apply some filters like Sobel.

2. The second project consisted in an implementation of the VGG16 architecture using a dataset that have chest-x-rays, some goals of the project is to find the number of filters by layers and how to work with the pooling operation.
