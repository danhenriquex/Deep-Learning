# Deep-Learning
Applications of Deep Learning

1. The first project consisted in a convolutional implementation where we learned how to work with padding and no-padding and how to apply some filters like Sobel.

2. The second project consisted in an implementation of the VGG16 architecture using a dataset that have chest-x-rays. The aim was to replicate the analysis made in the article, but using vgg16 and comparing the results using pooling operation ( None, avg max ), weights initialization and transfer learning.
